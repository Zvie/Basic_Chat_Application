# Trevino Chat App - Java

This is a basic chat application that was built by me Jeremy Trevino to show my understanding of Java and 
Server Sockets. 

To chat users Must know the IP and the open port of the person they want to message.
 
The same can also be said about the person who recieves the message. 

The application itself is very basic, but I plan to build on it and potentially make the application more complex and 

better to look at. 

The classes all have comments explaining what some of the lines do and what they're for.
